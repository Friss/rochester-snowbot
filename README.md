# BostonSnowbot

A Twitter bot that tells you the forecast for Boston, but more importantly tells you when that forecast changes. It uses the lovely [Forecast.io API](https://developer.forecast.io/). It's basically a more push than pull version of my existing habit of checking the forecast every few hours in the winter months.
